# Project-1: HIKE LOCAL

This application will give users a list of hiking trails in their area based on a set of criteria.  Users will be asked their location, desired trail rating, desired difficulty, and desired length.  Based on these inputs, our app will generate a list of trails according to their search.  They will also be able to see the weather for that morning, afternoon and evening.  Our app will also show a picture that will give a preview of what the area looks like.  This will be a useful tool for the weekend warriors looking for some new trails to try.
